# Decisions

This append-only log records choices and deviations made under `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` §0.1.

## D-001 Define omitted widget defaults and coordinate types (2026-09-23, phase 0)

- Context: `DEVELOPMENT.md` §9.3 names `WidgetSettings { visible, x, y, variant, opacity }` but does not specify defaults for those fields or concrete coordinate types.
- Rule applied: DEVELOPMENT.md §0.1 “Spec is silent on a detail”.
- Decision: use `visible = false`, `x = None`, `y = None`, `variant = Pill`, `opacity = 1.0`; represent saved coordinates as nullable signed 32-bit integers.
- Why: hidden is non-intrusive on first launch; absent coordinates let macOS choose an initial placement; Pill is the configured native default size; full opacity is the neutral default and avoids treating the artboard's sample 75% as product data; signed integer physical coordinates map directly to Tauri move events and support monitors left/above the primary display. Alternatives such as visible-by-default or zero coordinates would surprise users or force the widget onto the primary screen.
- Evidence: `DEVELOPMENT.md` §§9.3, 10.1–10.2 and `docs/design/screenshots/SettingsDisplay{Dark,Light}.png`.
